-Sass was created for variables
-Sass is converted into CSS --> it wasn't originally recognized by the browsers because the browsers 
	only recognize css (Sass was not a product introduced by W3C or the big browser names)
	-CSS variables (produced by the big names) aren't supported by all browsers --> thus use Sass

-need nodeJS as it will be the file that's converting Sass into CSS
-format for json files are very important -> npm init will give you the table of contents....pay attention to it
	-npm = note package manager --> nodeJS is packed inside a C++ enviornment vs java which is just inside the brower enviorment
	-npm install gulp --save-dev ---> installs program for you
-first number of gulp is the version --> if you bump to the next version there maybe compatiblilty issues eg we're at ^3
	-next number is compatiblity changes 9
	-and the last is debugging 1
	-^3.9.1
	-dependencies are stuff that you need for your program to work --> when you deploy you deploy those dependencies
		-when you do command npm install gulp --save
	-devDependencies is only for development --> you need the library
		-do this by default
	-never check in node modules since it's not actually our codes

-create file for gulp --> has to be called gulpfile.js        // https://gulpjs.com
	-everything in this file is nodeJS --> can't do this in normal JS
	-gulp runs tasks for our program that's it
	-npm i gulp-sass --save-dev for gulp sass https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass
	-if there's an error in your SASS it npm stops running at the point of the error so fix the error and re-run it --> npm run gulp
	-cntrl C to stop watching....



header {
	@media (max-width: 200px) {
	background: red; 
	}
	& :hover {
	}

}


so in sasss you can nest media queries inside the cards.
