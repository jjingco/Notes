Weight

-inheritance is weaker than if you tell it specifically what to do, even if the tag comes after, if it's generic
compared to specific the specific will over-ride the other, for instance,
the following principles will override the most current demands:

Principles that determin weight:
1. default styles
2. inherited or direct
3. specification
4. type (tag, class, id)
5. keywords 
	eg taging "!important" beside the color in your css will override the other colors regardless where it's located on the page
	-never use these or inline styles or ids --> usually shows you have no idea what you're doing
	-specificity calculator --> classes always wins with exception of #id
