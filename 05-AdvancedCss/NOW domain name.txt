getting an alias domain name through Zeit:

-use command line
	-first of all you need a domain name --> either through aws or zeit
	-which ever service you want to use buy the domain name with it or you'll have to transfer it --> paperwork
-type "now --help"
	eg: now domains --help
-type "now domains"
	-now domain buy "nameof your company you propose"
-deploy the one you want given you already have bought a site and you just want to change it to something new
	-now alias "the one you deployed"  "your alias that you want"

-if there was a problem just roll it back --> restore to original
	-now ls --> now alias "the one you picked that had a problem" and replace it with something else (might google)

-&& allows you to do multiple stuff with one command
	eg now && now alias "the thing you want" = deploy and change the alias

-subdomains can be used for demos 
	eg demo."whatever your site is called" --> now && now alias "demo.whateveryoursite is called"
